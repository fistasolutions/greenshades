## Example Update Template

**Before (Generic):**
```python
def process_order(order):
    """Process customer order"""
    # Calculate total
    total = sum(item.price for item in order.items)
    return total
```

**After (Greenshades - Payroll):**
```python
def process_payroll_batch(batch):
    """Process payroll batch for employees"""
    # Calculate total payroll amount
    total = sum(employee.gross_pay for employee in batch.employees)
    return total
```

**Before (Generic Prompt):**
"Generate a product description for an e-commerce website"

**After (Greenshades Prompt):**
"Generate a payroll report description for Avocado platform showing employee pay summaries"
