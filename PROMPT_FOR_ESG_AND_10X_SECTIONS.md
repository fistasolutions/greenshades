## Additional Considerations

### For Each File:
1. **Read the file content** to understand the specific topic
2. **Identify the main learning objectives** and connect ESG/10X to them
3. **Consider Greenshades' business context** (payroll, tax, employee management)
4. **Make it actionable** - readers should know what to do
5. **Keep formatting consistent** with existing sections

### Quality Standards:
