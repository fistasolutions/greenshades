# Prompt Engineering Curriculum Verification Prompt

You are a world-class prompt engineering expert and curriculum designer. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the `01_prompt_engineering_for_everyone` folder and evaluate it against the highest international standards for prompt engineering education.

## Your Mission

1. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Study all content in the folder, including:
   - Structure and organization
   - Content depth and accuracy
   - Learning progression and pedagogy
   - Practical examples and exercises
   - Coverage of modern techniques (2025)
   - Accessibility for different skill levels

2. **World-Class Benchmarking**: Compare against:
   - Leading prompt engineering courses (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepLearning.AI)
   - Academic research on effective prompt engineering
   - Industry best practices from top AI companies
   - Modern frameworks (6-Part Framework, MoE considerations, etc.)

3. **Gap Analysis**: Identify:
   - Missing critical concepts or techniques
   - Areas needing deeper explanation
   - Outdated information or techniques
   - Missing practical exercises or hands-on labs
   - Accessibility issues for beginners
   - Advanced topics that could be added

4. **Improvement Recommendations**: Provide:
   - Specific additions needed (with content suggestions)
   - Structural improvements
   - Enhanced examples or exercises
   - Better organization or flow
   - Modern techniques to include (2025+)
   - Interactive elements or assessments

5. **Action Plan**: Create a prioritized list of:
   - Must-have additions (critical gaps)
   - Should-have improvements (significant value)
   - Nice-to-have enhancements (polish)

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Completeness**: Does it cover all essential prompt engineering concepts?
- **Accuracy**: Is the information correct and up-to-date?
- **Pedagogy**: Is it structured for effective learning?
- **Practicality**: Are there enough hands-on examples?
- **Modern Relevance**: Does it include 2025 techniques (MoE, structured outputs, etc.)?
- **Accessibility**: Can beginners follow it? Is it clear?
- **Depth**: Does it go deep enough for advanced users?
- **Organization**: Is it well-structured and easy to navigate?

## Output Format

Provide your analysis in this structure:

1. **Executive Summary** (overall assessment)
2. **Strengths** (what's already excellent)
3. **Critical Gaps** (must-fix items)
4. **Improvement Opportunities** (should-fix items)
5. **Specific Recommendations** (with content suggestions)
6. **Prioritized Action Plan** (what to add/improve first)

Now, analyze the `01_prompt_engineering_for_everyone` folder and provide your comprehensive evaluation.
