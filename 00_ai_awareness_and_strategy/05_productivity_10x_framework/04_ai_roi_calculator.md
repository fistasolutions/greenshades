### AI ROI Formula

**ROI = (Hours_Saved × Hourly_Rate × Adoption_Rate) – (Licensing + Enablement_Cost)**

**Components:**
- **Hours_Saved:** Time saved per person per week/month
- **Hourly_Rate:** Average hourly cost (salary + benefits)
- **Adoption_Rate:** Percentage of team using AI (0-100%)
- **Licensing:** Annual AI tool costs
- **Enablement_Cost:** Training, setup, support costs

**ROI Percentage:**
**ROI% = ((Benefits - Costs) / Costs) × 100**

---

### ROI Calculation Example: GitHub Copilot for Developers

**Scenario:** 50 developers using GitHub Copilot

**Inputs:**
- **Hours_Saved:** 10 hours/week per developer (30% productivity gain)
- **Hourly_Rate:** $75/hour (average developer cost)
- **Adoption_Rate:** 90% (45 of 50 developers actively using)
- **Licensing:** $19/month × 50 developers × 12 months = $11,400/year
- **Enablement_Cost:** $5,000 (training, setup)

**Calculation:**
```
Benefits = Hours_Saved × Hourly_Rate × Adoption_Rate × Weeks_Per_Year
Benefits = 10 hours/week × $75/hour × 45 developers × 52 weeks
Benefits = $1,755,000/year

Costs = Licensing + Enablement_Cost
Costs = $11,400 + $5,000 = $16,400/year

ROI = Benefits - Costs
ROI = $1,755,000 - $16,400 = $1,738,600/year

ROI% = (($1,738,600) / $16,400) × 100 = 10,601%
```

**Result:** 10,601% ROI, $1.74M annual benefit

### ROI Calculation Example: AI Chatbot for Support

**Scenario:** Support team using AI chatbot

**Inputs:**
- **Hours_Saved:** 24 hours/week (60% of inquiries automated)
- **Hourly_Rate:** $50/hour (average support cost)
- **Adoption_Rate:** 100% (chatbot handles inquiries automatically)
- **Licensing:** $5,000/year (chatbot platform)
- **Enablement_Cost:** $10,000 (setup, training, integration)

**Calculation:**
```
Benefits = 24 hours/week × $50/hour × 52 weeks
Benefits = $62,400/year

Costs = $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000/year

ROI = $62,400 - $15,000 = $47,400/year

ROI% = ($47,400 / $15,000) × 100 = 316%
```

**Result:** 316% ROI, $47K annual benefit

### ROI Projection: 3-Year View

**Year 1:**
- Benefits: $500K (gradual adoption)
- Costs: $100K (licensing + enablement)
- ROI: $400K (400%)

**Year 2:**
- Benefits: $1,200K (full adoption)
- Costs: $80K (licensing, reduced enablement)
- ROI: $1,120K (1,400%)

**Year 3:**
- Benefits: $1,500K (optimized usage)
- Costs: $70K (licensing, minimal support)
- ROI: $1,430K (2,043%)

**3-Year Total ROI:** $2,950K (2,950% cumulative)

## Try It: Exercise

**Scenario:** You're evaluating AI for payroll anomaly detection.

**Inputs:**
- **Hours_Saved:** 18 hours/week (analyst time saved)
- **Hourly_Rate:** $55/hour
- **Adoption_Rate:** 100%
- **Licensing:** $15,000/year
- **Enablement_Cost:** $20,000 (one-time)

**Task:** Calculate ROI for Year 1 and Year 2 (assume enablement cost is Year 1 only).

**Solution:**
**Year 1:**
```
Benefits = 18 hours/week × $55/hour × 52 weeks = $51,480/year
Costs = $15,000 + $20,000 = $35,000/year
ROI = $51,480 - $35,000 = $16,480/year
ROI% = ($16,480 / $35,000) × 100 = 47%
```

**Year 2:**
```
Benefits = $51,480/year (same)
Costs = $15,000/year (no enablement cost)
ROI = $51,480 - $15,000 = $36,480/year
ROI% = ($36,480 / $15,000) × 100 = 243%
```

## 5-Question Quiz

### Question 1 (Multiple Choice)
What is the AI ROI formula?

a) (Benefits - Costs) / Costs × 100  
b) (Hours_Saved × Hourly_Rate × Adoption_Rate) – (Licensing + Enablement_Cost)  
c) Benefits / Costs  
d) All of the above

**Answer:** b) (Hours_Saved × Hourly_Rate × Adoption_Rate) – (Licensing + Enablement_Cost) (this is the ROI calculation; ROI% uses formula a)

---

### Question 2 (True/False)
Adoption rate significantly impacts ROI—low adoption reduces ROI even if time savings are high.

**Answer:** True

---

### Question 3 (Short Answer)
Name one component of the ROI calculation.

**Answer:** Hours_Saved, Hourly_Rate, Adoption_Rate, Licensing, or Enablement_Cost

---

### Question 4 (Multiple Choice)
If benefits are $100K/year and costs are $20K/year, what is the ROI?

a) $80K  
b) 400%  
c) Both a and b  
d) None of the above

**Answer:** c) Both a and b ($80K ROI, 400% ROI%)

---

### Question 5 (Short Answer)
Why does ROI typically improve in Year 2 compared to Year 1?

**Answer:** Enablement costs are one-time (Year 1), so Year 2 has lower costs while benefits remain the same or increase with better adoption.

## Security & Compliance Note

⚠️ **Red Flags Checklist:**
- [ ] ROI calculations should be conservative—use realistic adoption rates and time savings
- [ ] Include all costs (hidden costs: support, maintenance, security)
- [ ] Verify time savings with actual measurements, not estimates
- [ ] Consider risk factors (low adoption, tool failures, security issues)
