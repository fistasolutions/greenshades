## Core Content

### Metrics Framework

**Three Categories of Metrics:**
1. **Efficiency Metrics:** Time savings, speed improvements
2. **Output Metrics:** Volume of work completed
3. **Quality Metrics:** Accuracy, error rates, customer satisfaction

**Key Principle:** Measure what matters—focus on metrics that drive business value.

---

### Efficiency Metrics

#### Time Savings
**Definition:** Reduction in time spent on tasks after AI adoption

**How to Measure:**
- Track time before AI: Baseline measurement
- Track time after AI: Post-adoption measurement
- Calculate: `Time_Saved = Time_Before - Time_After`
- Percentage: `Time_Saved% = (Time_Saved / Time_Before) × 100`

**Example:**
```
Before AI: 20 hours/week on test case creation
After AI: 6 hours/week on test case creation
Time Saved: 14 hours/week (70% reduction)
```

**Targets:**
- Code generation: 30-50% time savings
- Test creation: 70% time savings
- Document processing: 80% time savings
- Monitoring: 90% time savings

---

#### Speed Improvements
**Definition:** Increase in work completion speed

**How to Measure:**
- Tasks per hour before AI
- Tasks per hour after AI
- Calculate: `Speed_Increase = (Tasks_After / Tasks_Before) × 100`

**Example:**
```
Before AI: 5 test cases/hour
After AI: 50 test cases/hour (AI-generated)
Speed Increase: 10× (1,000% increase)
```

**Targets:**
- Development velocity: 30-50% faster
- Test execution: 10× faster (automation)
- Report generation: 5× faster

---

### Output Metrics

#### Volume of Work
**Definition:** Amount of work completed in same time period

**How to Measure:**
- Output before AI (features, tests, documents per week)
- Output after AI (features, tests, documents per week)
- Calculate: `Output_Increase = (Output_After / Output_Before) × 100`

**Example:**
```
Before AI: 2 features/week
After AI: 10 features/week (with AI assistance)
Output Increase: 5× (500% increase)
```

**Targets:**
- Features delivered: 2-5× increase
- Test cases: 10× increase
- Documentation: 5× increase

---

#### Adoption Rate
**Definition:** Percentage of team using AI tools

**How to Measure:**
- Number of team members using AI tools
- Total team members
- Calculate: `Adoption_Rate = (Users / Total) × 100`

**Example:**
```
Team Size: 50 developers
AI Tool Users: 45 developers
Adoption Rate: 90%
```

**Targets:**
- Developer tools: 90%+ adoption
- Support tools: 100% adoption (automated)
- Analysis tools: 80%+ adoption

---

### Quality Metrics

#### Error Reduction
**Definition:** Decrease in errors after AI adoption

**How to Measure:**
- Error rate before AI (errors per 100 tasks)
- Error rate after AI (errors per 100 tasks)
- Calculate: `Error_Reduction = (Errors_Before - Errors_After) / Errors_Before × 100`

**Example:**
```
Before AI: 10 errors per 100 payroll calculations
After AI: 2 errors per 100 payroll calculations
Error Reduction: 80%
```

**Targets:**
- Code bugs: 40% reduction
- Data entry errors: 70% reduction
- Calculation errors: 80% reduction

---

#### Accuracy Improvements
**Definition:** Increase in accuracy of AI-assisted work

**How to Measure:**
- Accuracy before AI (correct outputs / total outputs)
- Accuracy after AI (correct outputs / total outputs)
- Calculate: `Accuracy_Improvement = Accuracy_After - Accuracy_Before`

**Example:**
```
Before AI: 80% accuracy in tax code classification
After AI: 95% accuracy in tax code classification
Accuracy Improvement: 15 percentage points
```

**Targets:**
- Classification accuracy: 90%+
- Detection accuracy: 95%+

### ROI Metrics

#### Cost Savings
**Definition:** Reduction in labor and operational costs

**How to Measure:**
- Labor costs before AI (hours × hourly rate)
- Labor costs after AI (hours × hourly rate)
- Calculate: `Cost_Savings = Costs_Before - Costs_After`

**Example:**
```
Before AI: 20 hours/week × $75/hour = $1,500/week
After AI: 2 hours/week × $75/hour = $150/week
Cost Savings: $1,350/week ($70,200/year)
```

---

#### ROI Calculation
**Definition:** Return on investment in AI tools and training

**Formula:** `ROI = (Benefits - Costs) / Costs × 100`

**Components:**
- Benefits: Time savings, cost reduction, revenue impact
- Costs: Tool licensing, training, infrastructure

**Example:**
```
Benefits: $200,000/year (time savings, cost reduction)
Costs: $50,000/year (licensing, training, infrastructure)
ROI = ($200,000 - $50,000) / $50,000 × 100 = 300%
```

**Targets:**
- Year 1: 100-300% ROI
- Year 2: 300-500% ROI
- Year 3: 500%+ ROI
