**Guidelines:**
- ✅ Human review required for critical decisions (hiring, payroll, tax)
- ✅ Human approval required for high-stakes outcomes
- ✅ Human can override AI decisions
- ❌ Don't automate critical decisions without human oversight
- ❌ Don't remove human judgment from important processes

**Example:**
- ✅ AI recommends hiring candidate, human makes final decision
- ❌ AI automatically hires candidates without human review

### Ethical Dilemmas and Decision Framework

#### Dilemma 1: Efficiency vs. Accuracy
**Scenario:** AI can process 10× faster but has 5% error rate

**Decision Framework:**
1. Assess risk: What are consequences of errors?
2. Evaluate trade-offs: Is speed worth accuracy loss?
3. Mitigate risk: Can we reduce errors while maintaining speed?
4. Make decision: Based on risk assessment and mitigation

**Example:**
- Payroll processing: Accuracy critical → Use AI with human verification
- Document processing: Speed important, errors fixable → Use AI with review

---

#### Dilemma 2: Automation vs. Employment
**Scenario:** AI can automate tasks, potentially reducing jobs

**Decision Framework:**
1. Assess impact: How many jobs affected?
2. Evaluate alternatives: Can AI augment rather than replace?
3. Plan transition: Retrain employees for new roles
4. Make decision: Balance efficiency and employment

**Example:**
- Use AI to augment employees (make them more productive) rather than replace
- Retrain employees for higher-value work

---

#### Dilemma 3: Privacy vs. Functionality
**Scenario:** AI needs data to function, but data is sensitive

**Decision Framework:**
1. Assess necessity: Is sensitive data really needed?
2. Evaluate alternatives: Can we use placeholders or synthetic data?
3. Implement safeguards: Encryption, access controls, audit trails
4. Make decision: Balance functionality and privacy

**Example:**
- Use placeholders in external AI tools
- Use internal AI tools with encryption for sensitive data
