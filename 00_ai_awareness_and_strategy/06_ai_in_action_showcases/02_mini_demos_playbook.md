### Common Demo Questions and Answers

#### Q: How accurate is the AI?
**A:** "AI accuracy varies by use case. For code generation, we see 95%+ accuracy with review. For anomaly detection, 95% detection rate with 5% false positives. We always recommend human review for critical decisions."

#### Q: Will AI replace our jobs?
**A:** "No. AI augments human capabilities, making teams more productive. We've seen 10× productivity gains—teams accomplish more, not fewer people. AI handles repetitive tasks, freeing humans for strategic work."

#### Q: Is AI secure and compliant?
**A:** "Yes. We follow strict security and compliance policies. All sensitive data is encrypted, access is controlled, and audit trails are maintained. We comply with GDPR, CCPA, and payroll regulations."

#### Q: What's the ROI?
**A:** "Typical ROI is 300-1,200% in the first year. For example, code generation saves 8 hours/week per developer—that's $30K/year per developer at $75/hour. Tool costs are $200-400/year per developer."

#### Q: How long does implementation take?
**A:** "Implementation varies by use case. Tool setup: 1-2 weeks. Training: 2-4 weeks. Full adoption: 2-3 months. We take a phased approach to manage risk and ensure success."
