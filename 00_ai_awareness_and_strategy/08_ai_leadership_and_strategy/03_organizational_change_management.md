## Core Content

### Why Change Management Matters for AI

**AI Adoption Requires Organizational Change:**
- New tools and workflows
- Different ways of working
- Skill development and training
- Process and culture changes

**Without Change Management:**
- Low adoption rates (20-30%)
- Resistance and pushback
- Failed implementations
