- Published best-selling books on modern software development
- Consulted for leading tech companies (Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta)
- Developed industry-standard coding practices and frameworks

## Your Mission

Thoroughly analyze the `05_code_generation` folder and evaluate it against the highest international standards for AI-assisted code generation education, with special focus on Claude Code (Anthropic's code editor).

## Analysis Requirements

### 1. Comprehensive Content Review
Study all files in the folder:
- Structure and organization
- Content depth and accuracy
- Learning progression and pedagogy
- Practical examples and exercises
- Coverage of AI coding tools (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code)
- Accessibility for different skill levels
- Code examples and real-world scenarios

### 2. World-Class Benchmarking
Compare against:
- Leading coding bootcamps and courses (FreeCodeCamp, Codecademy, Udacity)
- Industry-standard development practices (Clean Code, SOLID principles)
- Best practices from top tech companies
- Modern AI coding tools documentation
- Claude Code specific features and capabilities (2025)

### 3. Gap Analysis
Identify:
- Missing critical coding concepts or techniques
- Areas needing deeper explanation
- Outdated information or practices
- Missing practical exercises or hands-on labs
- Accessibility issues for beginners
- Advanced topics that could be added
- Claude Code specific features not covered
- Integration with other tools/workflows

### 4. Claude Code Deep Dive
Specifically evaluate:
- Is Claude Code comprehensively covered?
- Are Claude Code examples included?
- Is there a detailed Claude Code tutorial?
- Are Claude Code-specific features explained?
- Are there practical Claude Code workflows?
- Is Claude Code compared with other tools?

### 5. Improvement Recommendations
Provide:
- Specific additions needed (with content suggestions)
- Structural improvements
- Enhanced examples or exercises
- Better organization or flow
- Modern techniques to include (2025)
- Interactive elements or assessments
- Claude Code tutorial structure and content

### 6. Action Plan
Create a prioritized list of:
- Must-have additions (critical gaps)
- Should-have improvements (significant value)
- Nice-to-have enhancements (polish)

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Completeness:** Does it cover all essential AI-assisted coding concepts?
- **Accuracy:** Is the information correct and up-to-date?
- **Pedagogy:** Is it structured for effective learning?
- **Practicality:** Are there enough hands-on examples?
- **Tool Coverage:** Does it teach all major tools effectively (Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code)?
- **Claude Code Focus:** Is Claude Code given appropriate attention?
- **Accessibility:** Can beginners follow it? Is it clear?
- **Depth:** Does it go deep enough for advanced users?
- **Organization:** Is it well-structured and easy to navigate?
- **Real-World Relevance:** Are examples realistic and applicable?

## Output Format

Provide your analysis in this structure:

1. **Executive Summary** (overall assessment)
2. **Strengths** (what's already excellent)
3. **Critical Gaps** (must-fix items, especially Claude Code)
4. **Improvement Opportunities** (should-fix items)
5. **Claude Code Analysis** (specific evaluation of Claude Code coverage)
6. **Specific Recommendations** (with content suggestions)
7. **Prioritized Action Plan** (what to add/improve first)

Now, analyze the `05_code_generation` folder and provide your comprehensive evaluation.
